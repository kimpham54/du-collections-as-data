      <description>JCRS nurses and patients
My name is Jack Maness. Iâ€™m an Associate Dean at the University of Denver Libraries, and my role in the Collections as Data project here at DU is essentially one of administrative support. Toward that end, I am committed to providing the team what it needs to not only meet its goals during the course of the funded work, but beyond; and doing so in such a way that we contribute to the larger research and learning community interested in analyzing collections as data, and using it to further our understanding of ourselves, one another, and our world.</description>
