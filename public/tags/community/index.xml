      <description>My name is Kim Pham and I am the IT Librarian in the Library Technology Services department at the University of Denver Main Library. My role in our collections as data project is largely that of a project manager&amp;rsquo;s - I coordinate the various goings on and do some of the high-level design and specification work to create our digital collections as data. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read any of the other blog posts, more specifically we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on producing machine-readable transcripts from the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society records, a series of handwritten medical documents application letters, cheques, and more.</description>
